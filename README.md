- Node.js and npm - [Download and Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- MongoDB - [Download and Install MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- Git - [Download and Install Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/timothychangke/WhatsCookin
    ```
2. Create a .env file in the server folder. The Environment Variables have been emailed to Teaching Assistant Xue Zheng Hai. Email me at tchangka001@e.ntu.edu.sg to request a copy.

3. Navigate to the server directory:

    ```bash
    cd server
